# Example configuration demonstrating multiple from versions
# This allows selective updates - only modules at specified versions will be updated

modules:
  # Update S3 bucket modules from versions 3.0.0 or ~> 3.0 to 4.0.0
  # Modules at other versions (e.g., 3.1.0) will remain unchanged
  - source: "terraform-aws-modules/s3-bucket/aws"
    version: "4.0.0"
    from:
      - "3.0.0"
      - "~> 3.0"

  # Update VPC modules from multiple specific versions
  - source: "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
    version: "5.0.0"
    from:
      - "3.14.0"
      - "4.0.0"
      - "~> 4.0"

  # Single from version still works (backward compatible)
  - source: "terraform-aws-modules/security-group/aws"
    version: "5.1.0"
    from: "5.0.0"
